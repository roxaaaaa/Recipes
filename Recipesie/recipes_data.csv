" I used an acorn squash and recipe Sweet Mexican spice blend. Only used 1 tsp honey & 1 tsp butter between both halves,, sprinkled the squash liberally with the spice mix. Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl",5,2006-02-18 10:40:00,2024-10-12 16:31:00,mariagallagher@recipes.ie,arriba baked winter squash mexican style,,
This was a nice change. I used butternut squash and the sweet option using a good local honey and unsalted butter. I did not add salt. We ate this on top of recipe#322603 with Balkan yogurt. I may make this again same option. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010.,5,2011-12-05 10:40:01,2024-10-12 16:31:01,markmccann@recipes.ie,arriba baked winter squash mexican style,,
Excellent recipe! I used butternut squash and the sweet option. The mexican spice mix put this over the top. Thanks for sharing.,5,2010-08-21 10:40:02,2024-10-12 16:31:02,lunarodriguez@recipes.ie,arriba baked winter squash mexican style,,
"This is an excellent, easy-fix side-dish w/tons of flavor that we enjoyed for dinner w/simple poached fish fillets that really needed to be jazzed up a bit. I did have to use dried herbs & the Icelandic equivalent of the alouette, but it is very close to the real thing. I was a bit unsure early on Re peeling the potatoes or not + cooking them sliced or whole, but eventually opted to cook them sliced & unpeeled which worked well. I did not grease my baking dish & suggest deleting that as the olive oil does that job. The combo of herbs + alouette gives this a very good flavor & the surprise was how much the bell pepper added to the flavor, texture & of course the presentation. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)",4,2006-02-18 10:40:01,2024-10-12 16:31:03,mariagallagher@recipes.ie,alouette potatoes,,

I made this for dinner tonight and the chops were tasty and fork tender! If you are salt sensitive (I am not) I would cut back on the salt and look for low sodium soup. I couldn't resist adding a half cup of white wine and thicken the juices. This was excellent served with rice and chive buttered fresh carrots. For a simple meal that is hardy this is just the ticket!,5,2006-02-18 10:40:02,2024-10-12 16:31:06,mariagallagher@recipes.ie,chicken lickin good porkchops,,

"This was excellent. I bought chops that were just over an inch thick and let them cook for a solid 8 hours. The sauce made from the meat and soup was delicious served over couscous. I served this with Roosie's Zucotte (#96811) and we had a great meal.  The meat fell right off the bones, it was so tender and juicy.

"I didn't realize that this was a crock pot recipe until I was getting started on planning dinner only a couple of hours to go so I made it in a fry pan- reduced the recipe to 1 chop, used the whole tin of soup, 1 1/2 tsp mustard and the full garlic. Browned the chop, poured in the soup mixture and cooked it at 2 element level for the full 2 hours. Perfect and the aroma in the house was wonderfull. I added some broccoli & peppers last 10 minutes, served with steamed carrots Wonderful dinner thanks Chuck",5,2011-12-05 10:40:04,2024-10-12 16:31:10,katrinawalsh@recipes.ie,chicken lickin good porkchops,,

"Very good!  This is so similar to one of my favorite chicken recipes (Recipe #204668) that I can't believe I didnt' think to try it with pork chops myself.  I served this with wild rice and steamed veggies.  I just eyeballed the seasoning amounts, so I'm sure I used more than called for on some.

"This is pretty good!  I made a couple of minor substitutions:  I don't have beef bouillion because I usually have beef stock on hand, so I used the stock instead of the water and bouillion.  If I were to use bouillion, I would leave out the 2-1/2 tsp salt.  I seared the beef in a skillet on high heat, then deglazed the pan with a little red wine, putting that in the crockpot, too.  I added garlic and used fresh herbs.  The Beau had 3 helpings!",4,2006-02-18 10:40:09,2024-10-12 16:31:27,joancondell@recipes.ie,forgotten minestrone,,

"Very tasty bread!  I downsized the recipe for 1/2 of a loaf of French bread (split), and just added a portion of the packet of Hidden Valley to taste.  I also used unsalted butter, as the dressing mix can be very salty on its own.  I did not broil the bread, but instead heated on the top rack of my grill until toasty.  (I was grilling the remainder of the meal.)  As suggested, I served this as a side to bbq chicken with roasted corn on the cob and a tossed salad.  It was a great meal!

"I used the whole loaf, and the ranch mix is very salty. Next time I'll check to see if there is a low-sodium mix or try to make my own.",2,2006-02-18 10:40:10,2024-10-12 16:31:30,lauradoherty@recipes.ie,grilled ranch bread,,
This was incredibly tasty.  I used an indoor grill and grilled it.  I loved it for a yummy treat,5,2011-12-05 10:40:11,2024-10-12 16:31:31,helenmurphy@recipes.ie,grilled ranch bread,,
My family loves this.  This is one of our favorites breads.  This is even good with Spaghetti.,5,2010-08-21 10:40:12,2024-10-12 16:31:32,erinryan@recipes.ie,grilled ranch bread,,
"Very nice way to get your greens.  I will cut the spinach down by half a box and use a bit less oregano next time.  I baked some as balls but then tried putting the mixture in mini muffin cups, which worked well too.  Thanks for another spinach treat for my repetoire!",4,2006-02-18 10:40:11,2024-10-12 16:31:33,cocogallagher@recipes.ie,i can t believe it is spinach,,
"I liked these - great flavor!  But they seemed more like ""breadballs"" to me.  I guess the name, I cant believe it's spinach is accurate, as I could hardly taste the spinach, but was looking forward to tasting it at least a little...  I added some fresh basil, and that added great ""umph"" to the taste factor.",3,2011-12-05 10:40:12,2024-10-12 16:31:34,aliceryan@recipes.ie,i can t believe it is spinach,,
I found this a very good recipe.  Easy and nutritionally good if a bit bland.  I used fresh basil 3X the amount in the recipe as it didn't specify dried or fresh.  Next time (and there will be some) I think I will add a bit of grated Parmesan cheese to the mix.  Just a bit so it wont overpower.,4,2010-08-21 10:40:13,2024-10-12 16:31:35,doramurray@recipes.ie,i can t believe it is spinach,,
